# network_flow_corteva
# solving approach
the algorithm pseudocode is attached.

# instruction
in line 2 change the "sheet_name:" to desired input

# Notes
- I think there are two errors in the data. only in input 6, the sum of the delivery amount does not match the sum of the sourcing

# alternative approached
- based on the algorithm in which the amount in each process is being updated, it could possibly be solved with dynamic programming
- since the nature of this problem is table based, it can be tried to solve with SQL too.
